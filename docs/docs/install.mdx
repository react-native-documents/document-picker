# Installation

There are two ways to consume the document picker package:

### Premium Version

This version offers many improvements over the public version. Full list of changes is [here](./sponsor-only/intro.md#whats-new-in-the-premium-packages). To mention a few:

✅ New: [`saveDocuments`](./sponsor-only/picker/save-as-dialog) function

✅ New: [`isKnownType`](./sponsor-only/picker/limiting-selectable-files.md#isknowntype) utility

✅ New: `open` mode support for both platforms

✅ New: long-term file access permissions on both platforms

✅ New: `keepLocalCopy` function that separates picking a file and copying it to a local directory, which makes your app more responsive.

... and [more](./sponsor-only/intro.md#whats-new-in-the-premium-packages)

Your support enables continued maintenance and development of the module. Thank you! ❤️

### Public Version

Available on the public npm registry, this version does not include the new features, updates and improvements found in the premium version.

## Accessing the premium version

Access is provided via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak): upon sponsoring you will get access to the private packages and to the private monorepo with the sources and examples (please use specifically the tiers that mention this package!).

Three steps are needed to access the premium packages, which are hosted on [GitHub npm packages registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry).

1. [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/vonovak) and accept private repository invitation - it takes just a few clicks.

2. [Obtain here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) a Personal Access Token with `packages:read` permission.

3. Set up your package manager so that it fetches the packages from the GH packages registry. In this example, we're using an `NPM_TOKEN` environment variable.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
  <TabItem value="classic" label="npm / yarn v1">
    create a `.npmrc` file in your project root with the following content:

```
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}

@react-native-documents:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="yarn v3+" label="yarn v3+">
    create a `.yarnrc.yml` file in your project root with the following content:

```yml
npmScopes:
  react-native-documents:
    npmRegistryServer: https://npm.pkg.github.com
    npmAuthToken: '${NPM_TOKEN}'
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

If you use another package manager ([such as bun](https://bun.sh/docs/install/registries)), please refer to its documentation on how to set up a custom registry.

## Installing

<Tabs className="unique-tabs">
    <TabItem value="premium" label="For sponsors">

        ```bash
        yarn add @react-native-documents/picker
        yarn add @react-native-documents/viewer
        ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="classic" label="Public package">

        The `viewer` package is not available in the public version.

        ```bash
        yarn add react-native-document-picker
        ```
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Setting up

:::warning
The premium document picker package requires iOS 14 or later. If you use Expo, use [Expo build properties](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/build-properties/#example-appjson-with-config-plugin) to update the `deploymentTarget` to `14`.

In regular React Native projects, update the [settings in Xcode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66798215/2070942).
:::

### Expo

:::info

This package cannot be used in ["Expo Go"](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds) because it requires custom native code.

However, you can add custom native code to Expo through a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds). That is the approach taken below.

:::

```bash
# install the package first

# Build the app locally
expo prebuild --clean
expo run:ios
expo run:android
```

### React Native

Install the package and then run `pod install` from the ios directory. Then rebuild your project with Xcode.

The packages support last 3 stable releases of RN, but very likely work with RN 0.73 an up.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), it's strongly recommended to use the latest stable release.

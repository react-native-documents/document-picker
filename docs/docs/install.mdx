# Installation

Depending on what module you need, install one or both of the packages:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-documents/picker
```

```bash
yarn add @react-native-documents/viewer
```

## Setting up

:::warning
The document picker package requires iOS 14 or later. If you use Expo, use Expo SDK >=52 or [Expo build properties](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/build-properties/#example-appjson-with-config-plugin) to update the `deploymentTarget` to `14`.

In regular React Native projects, use RN >= 0.76 or update the [settings in Xcode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66798215/2070942).

### Expo

:::info

These packages cannot be used in ["Expo Go"](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#expo-go-an-optional-tool-for-learning) because they require custom native code.

However, you can add custom native code to an Expo app through a [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/overview/#development-builds). That is the officially recommended approach for building Expo apps. See the commands below to do this.

:::

```bash
# install the package first

# Build the app locally
expo prebuild --clean
expo run:ios
expo run:android
```

### React Native

Install the package and then run `pod install` from the ios directory. Then rebuild your project with Xcode.

The packages support last 3 stable releases of RN, but very likely work with RN 0.73 and up.

If you're using the [New Architecture](https://reactnative.dev/docs/new-architecture-intro), it's strongly recommended to use the latest stable release of RN.

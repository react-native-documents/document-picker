:::note
Many of the fields are nullable because the file metadata might not be available in some cases. While it's unlikely, it can happen - especially on Android - if a user picks a file from a [Document Provider](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/create-document-provider) that doesn't make the information available.

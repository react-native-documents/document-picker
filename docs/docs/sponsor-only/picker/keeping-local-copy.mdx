# Keeping a local copy of the picked files {#keepLocalCopy}

[`keepLocalCopy`](/docs/doc-picker-api#keeplocalcopy) makes the file available in the app's storage. The behavior is different on iOS and Android:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem'

<Tabs queryString="current-os" className="unique-tabs">
    <TabItem value="android" label="Android">
        This method opens an `InputStream` pointing to the picked `content://` uri (from both Open and Import modes) and stores its bytes into a file - i.e. it can be used to "convert" a `content://` Uri into a local file. This file's location is determined by the `destination` parameter.

        It also "converts" [virtual files](./virtual-files.md) (such as Google Docs or sheets) into local files.

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="ios" label="iOS">
        On iOS, `keepLocalCopy` is only supported for the Import mode at the moment.

       Calling this method is strongly recommended, though not strictly necessary, as the file is already temporarily available in a location in the app's sandbox when it is picked.
        However, iOS appears to delete the file rather soon after it is returned to your app, hence the recommendation.

        `keepLocalCopy` is useful if you need to prevent / delay the file being deleted by the system (by moving it to the app's Documents / Cache directory, respectively).

        To prevent deletion, call `keepLocalCopy()` and pass `destination: "documentDirectory"`.
        This moves the file from the temporary location it is in when it is picked, into Documents directory, where the file lives until the app is uninstalled.
    </TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note

For each call of `keepLocalCopy`, a new unique directory is created in the app's storage, and the files are placed into it.

This way, the files are isolated and subsequent calls to `keepLocalCopy` with the same file names do not overwrite the previous files.

When writing to the filesystem, [path traversal vulnerability](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) is prevented. Writing files outside the intended destination will error.

```tsx title="Example: keeping a local copy of the picked file"
import { pick, keepLocalCopy } from '@react-native-documents/picker'
return (
  <Button
    title="single file import, and ensure it is available in the local storage"
    onPress={async () => {
      try {
        const [{ name, uri }] = await pick()

        const [copyResult] = await keepLocalCopy({
          files: [
            {
              uri,
              fileName: name ?? 'fallback-name',
            },
          ],
          destination: 'documentDirectory',
        })
        if (copyResult.status === 'success') {
          // do something
        }
      } catch (err) {
        // see error handling
      }
    }}
  />
)
```
